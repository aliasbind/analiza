All credit goes to Petre Ilia»ô from the Faculty of Computer Science,
University of Bucharest who held the course. I just "recopied" what I wrote
on my notebook during the semester, because my writing was very ugly and the
courses were not organized at all. This helped me learn LaTeX and study more
easily for the exam.

Keep in mind that the courses are in Romanian *only* and not very accurate.
I didn't have the time to check if what is written in there is 100% true.

To compile, open up a terminal and execute +make+ in the directory where
this repository was cloned. On ubuntu, you will need to have the
+texlive-full+ package installed. As for other operating systems, check the
+include.tex+ file for what LaTeX modules you might require.

The structure of the source code is very straightforward: files +1.tex+
through +14.tex+ contain the courses 1 to 14, +title.tex+ contains the cover
of the resulting PDF and +include.tex+ includes all the needed modules. The
bibliography is stored in +bibl.bib+ as a BibTeX file.
